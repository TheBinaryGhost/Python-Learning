#Here we will learn to use basic funtions in Python
#Using print function
print("Welcome to the king of programming language: Python!")
print(123)

#Using type function
#print(type(123))  # This will print the type of the number 123
a = 10
print(type(a))  # This will print the type of variable a, which is an integer
b = "python"
print(type(b))  # This will print the type of variable b, which is a string
c = 10.5
print(type(c))  # This will print the type of variable c, which is a float

#Using input function
a = input("Are you ready to learn Python? (yes/no): ")
print("A :", a)  # This will print the input received from the user

b = input("Enter the value of B: ")
print("B :", b)  # This will print the input received from the user
print(type(b))  # This will print the type of variable b
# Note: The input function always returns a string, so b will be of type str
