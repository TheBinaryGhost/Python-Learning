#Looping statements
#So first of all what is looping statement?
#Looping statements in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a certain number
#of times or until a specific condition is met.
#Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence.
#When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
#The most common looping statements in Python are for and while loops.
